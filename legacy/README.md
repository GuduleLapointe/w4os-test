A complete rewrite is in progress, using a more comprehensive structure.

In the meantime, the legacy code is kept in this folder and used the same way as before.

Eventually, all code should be rewritten in the main hierarchy and removed from here.

While not part of the standard naming structure, "helpers/" folder contains code from another project, so it should remain mostly unchanged.
